<p>This site is hosted statically. Originally by github but now with Netlify thanks to GitHub's lack of SSL support for custom domains. This is completely fine for most sites like this as there's no need for databases or server-side scripting. However I decided that I wanted a blog which didn't require me to copy and paste a html template for every page, and change each one individually if I want to change the format. So I decided to build a simple system for creating a list of posts that link to HTML files that only contain the HTML of the post, getting copied into the single blog.html page.</p>
