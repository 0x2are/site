				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>Hey, welcome to my website! This is the home of any projects that I deem to be interesting, useful or awesome enough to show off. </p>
				
				<p>I started teaching myself to program when I started high school, using some online Java tutorials (shoutout to <a href="https://thenewboston.com/">thenewboston</a>). Since then I've worked on many <strike>useful</strike> things in all sorts of languages. From games and mobile apps to physics simulations and networking tools.</p>
